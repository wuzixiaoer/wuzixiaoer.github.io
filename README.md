   A WeChat Mini Program for painterly harmonization                                                               
   • Image matting
   • An encoder self-attention decoder network to style transfer
   • Weighted semantic similar region style transfer
   • Weighted local neighboring region style transfer
2. **Motion-based Floor Identification using XGBoost**                                                2018
   An algorithm to identify floor in multi-story building accurately and quickly            
   • Wi-Fi-based floor identification using XGBoost
   • Combined Wi-Fi-based method and pressure-based method in hollow areas
   • Generated a motion detection of up and down stairs to reduce delay of identification
   • Achieved 98.83% accuracy which outperforms the state-of-arts works.
3. [**Safer Medicine**](https://github.com/wuzixiaoer/MedKnower.git)                                  2016                                                     
   An Android app for recognizing medicines’ names from pictures and giving safety reminders
   • Combined OCR with deeplearning4j to learn the feature of Chinese characters
   • Generated a character-tree for training the character recognition model
   • Reduced time in recognizing characters compared to traditional OCR
